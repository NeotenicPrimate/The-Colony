Computational social science is an interdisciplinary field that applies computational methods, data analysis, and computer-based models to study social phenomena and human behavior. It involves combining concepts and theories from social science disciplines, such as sociology, psychology, economics, and political science, with computational techniques and large-scale data analysis.
