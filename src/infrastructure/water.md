## Olla

<p align="center"><img src="../images/olla.png" /></p>

Ollas are unglazed clay pots used for efficient irrigation, especially in dry climates. They are buried in the ground near plant roots and filled with water. The porous terracotta material allows water to seep directly into the root zone at a rate dependent on soil moisture levels, thus reducing water waste due to runoff and evaporation. Ollas are refilled as needed and promote the development of deep, healthy root systems.
