# Greywater

Greywater refers to the wastewater generated from non-toilet plumbing fixtures and appliances in residential or commercial buildings. This type of wastewater includes water from sources such as:

- Sinks (kitchen and bathroom)
- Showers and bathtubs
- Washing machines
- Dishwashers

Greywater does not contain fecal matter, so it is considered less contaminated than blackwater. However, it can still have impurities and some level of chemical or organic content depending on the specific sources. Due to its relatively lower level of contamination, greywater can be treated and reused for certain non-potable purposes like irrigation, flushing toilets, and in some cases, laundry.

# Blackwater

Blackwater, on the other hand, is the wastewater that comes from toilets and contains human waste (feces and urine). It is highly contaminated and potentially carries harmful pathogens, making it a significant health risk. In addition to human waste, blackwater may also contain toilet paper and water used for flushing.

Due to its high level of contamination, blackwater must undergo extensive treatment before it can be safely discharged into the environment or reused. The treatment process for blackwater is more complex and requires higher levels of sanitation to ensure that harmful pathogens are removed effectively.
