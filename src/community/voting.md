## Ranked-Choice

Ranked-choice voting, also known as instant-runoff voting, is an electoral system in which voters rank candidates in order of preference. Instead of choosing only one candidate, voters have the option to rank multiple candidates from most preferred to least preferred. The counting process involves eliminating candidates with the fewest votes and reallocating their votes to the remaining candidates based on the voters' next preferences until a candidate receives a majority or predetermined threshold of votes.

## Unanimous

Unanimous voting is a decision-making process in which all participants or members of a group must agree or give their consent for a proposal, motion, or action to be approved. In a unanimous voting system, any dissent or objection from a single member can block the decision, resulting in the need for further discussion or modification of the proposal until it garners unanimous agreement.
