## Ranked-Choice

Ranked-choice voting, also known as instant-runoff voting, is an electoral system in which voters rank candidates in order of preference. Instead of choosing only one candidate, voters have the option to rank multiple candidates from most preferred to least preferred. The counting process involves eliminating candidates with the fewest votes and reallocating their votes to the remaining candidates based on the voters' next preferences until a candidate receives a majority or predetermined threshold of votes.

## Unanimous

Unanimous voting is a decision-making process in which all participants or members of a group must agree or give their consent for a proposal, motion, or action to be approved. In a unanimous voting system, any dissent or objection from a single member can block the decision, resulting in the need for further discussion or modification of the proposal until it garners unanimous agreement.

## Anonymity

Anonymity in voting is of paramount importance as it safeguards the fundamental principles of democracy and ensures a fair and unbiased electoral process. When individuals can cast their votes without fear of retaliation or judgment, they are more likely to express their true beliefs and preferences. This allows for a diverse range of perspectives to be represented in the electoral outcome, preventing the disproportionate influence of outspoken individuals or groups.

## Procedures

Having a weekly meeting of permanent members to make decisions about predefined issues is an efficient and collaborative approach to address key matters in a timely manner. The regularity of these gatherings fosters a cohesive environment where team members can actively engage and exchange ideas to arrive at well-considered decisions. With predefined issues set before each meeting, participants come prepared, streamlining the decision-making process and avoiding unnecessary delays.
