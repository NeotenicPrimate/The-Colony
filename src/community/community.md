## Permanent & Transient Community Members

Permanent community members are the core of the commune and should have a say in decision-making and be responsible for long-term planning. Transient members, on the other hand, could include visitors, volunteers, or short-term residents. 

##  Communal & Individual Spaces

Regarding private and communal spaces, finding the right balance is crucial to respect individual needs while nurturing a sense of community. Members should have private living spaces to ensure personal privacy and comfort. At the same time, communal spaces play a pivotal role in fostering social interactions and collaboration.
