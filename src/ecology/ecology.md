Permaculture is a holistic approach to agriculture and social design principles centered around simulating or directly utilizing the patterns and resilient features observed in natural ecosystems. Food forests are a prime example of permaculture in action. Unlike conventional farming methods, food forests aim to create a diverse and self-sustaining system that mimics a natural forest ecosystem. They include multiple layers of vegetation, from tall canopy trees to smaller understory plants, all chosen to complement and support each other. This complexity encourages beneficial relationships between plants and animals, enhancing soil fertility, pest control, and overall resilience.
