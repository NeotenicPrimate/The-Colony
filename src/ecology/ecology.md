In our commitment to ecological conservation and sustainable practices, we prioritize working with native species in all our projects. Native species are those that have evolved and adapted to specific environmental conditions over thousands of years, making them crucial to maintaining the balance and health of local ecosystems. By emphasizing their use, we not only promote biodiversity but also reduce the risks associated with introducing invasive species that can disrupt local habitats.

Permaculture is a holistic approach to agriculture and social design principles centered around simulating or directly utilizing the patterns and resilient features observed in natural ecosystems. Food forests are a prime example of permaculture in action. Unlike conventional farming methods, food forests aim to create a diverse and self-sustaining system that mimics a natural forest ecosystem. They include multiple layers of vegetation, from tall canopy trees to smaller understory plants, all chosen to complement and support each other. This complexity encourages beneficial relationships between plants and animals, enhancing soil fertility, pest control, and overall resilience.
