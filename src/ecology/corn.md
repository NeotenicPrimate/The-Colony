Corn, also known as maize, is a staple grain consumed in various forms across the globe. Nutritionally, it is primarily composed of carbohydrates, and it's a good source of energy. Corn also contains moderate amounts of protein and dietary fiber, especially when consumed as whole grain. While it's generally low in fat, corn does provide some essential fatty acids. It offers various vitamins and minerals, including B vitamins like thiamine, niacin, and folate, as well as minerals such as magnesium, iron, and zinc.
